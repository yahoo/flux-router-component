This package provides navigational React components and router React mixin for applications built with [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html) architecture.  Please check out [examples](https://github.com/yahoo/flux-router-component/tree/master/examples) of how to use these components.

## NavLink
`NavLink` is the a React component for navigational links.  When the link is clicked, NavLink will dispatch `NAVIGATE` action to flux dispatcher.  The dispatcher can then dispatch the action to the stores that can handle it.

### Example Usage
Example of using `NavLink` with `href` property defined:
```js
var NavLink = require('flux-router-component').NavLink;

var Nav = React.createClass({
    render: function () {
        var pages,
            links,
            context = this.props.context;  // this should have a router instance and an executeAction function
        pages = [
            {
                name: 'home',
                url: '/home',
                text: 'Home'
            },
            {
                name: 'about',
                url: '/about',
                text: 'About Us'
            }
        ];
        links = pages.map(function (page) {
            return (
                <li className="navItem">
                    <NavLink href={page.url} context={context}>
                        {page.text}
                    </NavLink>
                </li>
            );
        });
        return (
            <ul className="nav">
                {links}
            </ul>
        );

    }
});
```

We also have another more sophisticated example application, [routing](https://github.com/yahoo/flux-examples/tree/master/routing), that uses `NavLink` with `routeName` property defined.

## RouterMixin
`RouterMixin` is a React mixin to be used by application's top level React component to:

* manage browser history when route changes, and
* execute navigate action and then dispatch `CHANGE_ROUTE_START` and `CHANGE_ROUTE_SUCCESS` or `CHANGE_ROUTE_FAILURE` events via flux dispatcher on window `popstate` events


### Example Usage
```js
var RouterMixin = require('flux-router-component').RouterMixin;

var Application = React.createClass({
    mixins: [RouterMixin],
    ...
});
```

## Browser Support
This library supports browsers without native pushState, such as IE8 and IE9.  For these old browsers, the library will degrade to regular http get's.  Here is an example:

User clicks on a link to navigate from the current route `http://mydomain.com/home`, to a new route `http://mydomain.com/path/to/new/route`:

* HTML5 browsers with pushState support will have the url updated to the new route;
* IE8 and IE9 will make a complete HTTP GET to desired route.

## Polyfills
`addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` polyfills are provided by:

* Compatibility code example on [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener)
* A few DOM polyfill libaries listed on [Modernizer Polyfill wiki page](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills#dom).
